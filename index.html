                        </h3>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Flat Belly Tonic was developed by Mike Banner, a nutritionist, and personal trainer. He came to discover many of the ingredients from Dr. Tamaki, a Japanese cardiologist who recommended many of the ingredients in Flat Belly Tonic for weight loss. <br>

                            According to the official website, Dr. Tamaki and Mike Banner discussed the body & weight loss, which prompted Mike to look into herbal extracts that support weight loss. His research developed the formula that is now Flat Belly Tonic.     <br> <br>                   
                            <b>  <a style='color:black' target="_blank" class='new1'href="https://www.clkmg.com/Wolf012/okinawa-v2">Flat Belly Tonic is one of the newest weight loss drinks on the market</a></b> , but it is already delivering results to thousands of adults worldwide. If you're someone who is struggling to lose weight, then Flat Belly Tonic could be the solution you've been desperately looking to find.

                        </p>




                            <h3 class="heading-tertiary u-margin-bottom-small">How Does Okinawa Flat Belly Tonic Work?  

                                </h3>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Flat Belly Tonic contains a powerful formula of herbal extracts and berries to help you lose weight. <br> This potent formula works in two main ways to melt away fat: <br>
                      <br>
                     <b> Flat Belly Tonic boosts your body's metabolism to increase fat loss.</b> Flat Belly Tonic contains four herbal extracts that help boost your base metabolic rate (BMR). Your base metabolic rate is the # of calories needed for you to keep your body functioning at rest. By increasing your BMR, Flat Belly Tonic helps you burn more calories when you're not actively exercising. This enables you to burn more fat throughout the day so you can slim down faster.   <br> <br>
                    <b> Flat Belly Tonic reduces inflammation</b>, which slows down digestion and slows your metabolism. A potent blend of berry extracts has powerful antioxidant properties that combat inflammation. Inflammation, particularly a protein called C-reactive protein, blocks an enzyme called adiponectin. Adiponectin is an enzyme that triggers metabolic activity. Reducing C-reactive protein levels enables adiponectin to thrive, thus allowing your metabolism to thrive. <br><br>                      
                    Essentially,  <b>   <a style='color:black' target="_blank" class='new1'href="https://www.clkmg.com/Wolf012/okinawa-v2">Flat Belly Tonic directly boosts your metabolism</a></b> and puts your body in the best position to burn more fat naturally. This potent combination makes Flat Belly Tonic one of the most effective fat burners on the market.

                        </h3>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Before trying any supplement, it is essential to know the risks for side effects or other potential negative impacts on your health. Thankfully, Flat Belly Tonic is overwhelmingly safe. <br> <br>

                            All of the ingredients in Flat Belly Tonic have been clinically studied and demonstrated their safety in various clinical trials. Reports of side effects have been rare, although it is impossible to rule out the occasional headache or feeling of nausea. <br> <br>
                            
                            In general, Flat Belly Tonic is tolerated extremely well. There have not been any reports of significant side effects – or any adverse side effects for that matter. If, for any reason, some negative side effect develops, discontinue use and speak to a medical doctor if symptoms do not subside. The likelihood of this is extremely rare, but it cannot be ruled out. <br> <br>
                            
                            Also, the official website states that all ingredients are routinely tested for purity and quality. Flat Belly Tonic is manufactured in a GMP-approved facility in the United States, and it contains zero fillers, allergens, or other ingredients not listed on the label. Therefore, there should be no doubts about the quality of the product either. <br>

                        <h3 class="heading-tertiary u-margin-bottom-small">How Long Does It Take to See Results?

                        </h3>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            There is no doubt that Flat Belly Tonic can help you lose weight. There are plenty of testimonials from real users. However, you should not expect it to be a miracle cure because Flat Belly Tonic is not a miracle – there is no miracle weight loss pill. <br> <br>

                            However, if you give yourself time and make some dietary changes, then Flat Belly Tonic can amplify how much weight you lose every week. This is backed by science too. <br> <br>
                            
                            EGCG has been shown to stimulate weight loss in as little as two weeks. More extended periods of use have shown the effects of EGCG multiple as well. Inulin is another compound shown to support weight loss after a few weeks. <br> <br>
                            
                            Other ingredients like hibiscus and black pepper have demonstrated an ability to support weight loss after more extended periods of use – more so in the eight to ten-week range.   <br> <br>
                         <b>   So how long does it take to see results? </b><br>  <br>
                            
                            In general, most people begin to see results two to three weeks after starting Flat Belly Tonic. However, the best results usually come eight to ten weeks after starting it because all four ingredients in the metabolic blend begin to rev up your metabolism. <br> <br>
                            
                            This is why we recommend purchasing at least a three-month package to get the best chance of success. One bottle may not be enough to see results since hibiscus, black pepper, and some antioxidant compounds tend to take longer to deliver noticeable results.   <br>                        <br> <b>  <a style='color:black' target="_blank" class='new1'href="https://www.clkmg.com/Wolf012/okinawa-v2">
